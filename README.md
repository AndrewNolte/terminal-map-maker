# Terminal Map Maker

This project was created to help build layouts for strategy in the [Terminal game by Correlation 1](https://terminal.c1games.com).

It was created with React and rendered with NextJS (hosted on a server which uses NextJS for routing and rendering). More specifically, this repository was bootstrapped with `create-next-app`.

## Installation

Clone this repository and execute `npm install` in terminal. Then, you can host the server locally using `npm run dev`.
